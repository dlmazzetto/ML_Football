### Final Project - Spiced Academy 2020

#### Chosen dataset: FIFA 19 COMPLETE PLAYER DATASET ([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19))

- 18k + Fifa 19 players
- ~ 90 attributes

## 3 questions to answer:
1. Is it possible to come up with a machine learning model to predict the most appropriate playing position based on player attributes?
2. What features are the most relevant?
3. By adding more features to the models, will the precision increase?

### Key learnings:
1. Is it possible to come up with a machine learning model to predict the most appropriate playing position based on physical attributes? **Yes**
2. What features are the most relevant? **Depends on the correspondence with the reality the problem requires but features changing allows for more flexibility.**
3. By adding more features to the models, will the precision increase? **Yes**

### Next steps:
1. Extend my research on the model performance -Recall, F1 Score, etc.
2. Find the best features sets to improve the model performance- recursive feature elimination, etc.
3. Try to improve the performance using different models, such as: Random Forest, Deep learning, etc.
